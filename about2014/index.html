              <h1>Hi.</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m an independent writer, designer and publisher usually in Ottawa, Ontario, but often in Toronto and Virginia, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also co-founder and a writer at Hi, a realtime storytelling project. View my profile and subscribe to me: https://sayhi.co/people/craigmod.</p>

<p>January-April 2014 note: I&rsquo;m currently working towards the launch of <a href="http://athletebuilder.com/">Athlete Builder</a> which is consuming all of my time. Apologies for not being able to meet / respond to all requests. Thanks for understanding. I hope to have more time in the start of 2014.</p>

<h3>STARTUPS</h3>

<p>I love the culture of startups: the optimism, the naiveté, the confusion, the chaos, the compression. I regularly mentor and consult with &ldquo;publishing related&rdquo; (a vast and growing category if there ever was one) startups and try to nurture connections where connections should be.</p>

<p>For a little over a year, I was privileged to work at Flipboard as a product designer. My main focus was Flipboard for iPhone. I am indebted to the great
opportunity Mike, Evan, Marcos and the rest of the company extended to me. So much so, I made them a love letter(book?).</p>

<h3>TOKYO</h3>

<p>Tokyo was my base for nearly a decade and I return frequently. My experiences there are so deeply layered that I consider the city a hometown. All that time in Japan pushed my cultural expectations into strange territories; something I enjoy. Much of my design work is inspired by time spent there.</p>

<h3>MYTHS</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m adopted. So, naturally, I&rsquo;m fascinated by provenance. Provenance and
mythologies. Particularly the myths we create around ourselves and the
boundaries which define &lsquo;family.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>PERSPECTIVE</h3>

<p>Travel is my drug. Usually prescription based, although, at times, it can
feel illicit.</p>

<p>I bounce between San Francisco, New York and Tokyo. Sometimes, people have a
hard time understanding why. They tilt their heads. To me, it&rsquo;s simple: stay
sharp. Each time the plane lands I can hear the crisp scrape of my senses pushed
across a whetstone.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley gets foolish dreaming and technology.</p>

<p>New York gets content and process.</p>

<p>Tokyo gets objects and procession.</p>

<p>Simple, right?</p>

<h3>OPTIMISM</h3>

<p>I strive to be a technology optimist. Optimism is a meditation requiring
constant application. I believe technological change is like a freight train of
a certain unstoppablemomentum, and we have two broad choices:</p>

<p>• Stubbornly stand in front of the train and try to push it back</p>

<p>• Accept the train and be a force laying railroad ties which place it on a
nourishing course</p>

<p>I choose the second option, and that choice informs the way I look at how
digital infrastructure is affecting books, publishing and education. I like that
we're irrationallyemotional about the loss of physicality in books. We&rsquo;re
explorers, and the first rule of the Explorer&rsquo;s Club is: always choose a
disrupted space filled with intense emotion.</p>

<h3>SEE CHANGE</h3>

<p>I believe there is an emerging confluence of simple technologies around books, publishing, networks and education that can be leveraged to change the way we
think about learning and information accessibility. If you&rsquo;re working in this space, I&rsquo;d love to chat.</p>

<p>I think of the liminal space publishing now occupies as the pre/post era of publishing. We&rsquo;re post- the formality, complexity and physicality that so defined publishing following Gutenberg (and Aldus Manutius and Walter Benjamin
and …). But yet we&rsquo;re still pre- substantive alternatives.</p>

<p>The old guard is crumbling. A new guard is awkwardly emerging. Together, we can affect the shape of the new guard. Isn&rsquo;t that exciting?</p>

<h3>Erginomics and Cognative Science</h3>

<p>User Experience is discipline focused on designing the end-toend experience of a certain product. To design an experience means to plan and act upon a certain set of actions, which should result in a planned change in the behaviour of a target group (when interacting with a product)</p>

<p>A UX designer’s work should always be derived from people’s problems and aim at finding a pleasurable, seductive, inspiring solution. The results of that work should always be measurable through metrics describing user behaviour. UX
designers use knowledge and methods that originate from psychology, anthropology, sociology, computer science, graphic design, industrial design and cognitive science.</p>

<p>When you’re designing an experience, you are in fact planning a change in the behaviour of your target group. You’ve found out their problem and you’re trying to destroy the burden using design methods.</p>

<p>User experience lies at the crossroads of art and science and requires both extremely acute analytical thinking and creativity.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;What is is you do exactlly?&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Designing and implementing the first-run experience for their SaaS application, with the goal of increasing conversion from free trial signups to paying accounts and increasing lifetime value of paying accounts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Implementing a drip campaign, such as allowing potential customers to sign up for a free one-month mini-course on \$PICK_A_TOPIC, where the mini-course also duals as a sales channel for the SaaS product the company sells</p></li>
<li><p>Re-writing marketing site copy or re-doing design (I do wireframes, their designers make PSDs and working code, most of the time) to increase conversions to a SaaS product, generally with the new work getting A/B tested versus the old stuff so we know whether it is working or not Re-doing pricing / packaging options, or presenting them in a more effective light, to increase sales, average order value, and
average customer lifetime value.</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching teams at clients to implement A/B testing, email, better pricing/packaging options, etc etc so that clients can get good at these rather than needing to rely on me.</p></li>
<li><p>Being a sounding board for product / UX / packaging / etc decisions. (e.g. “We’re considering moving a very successful desktop application sold on a licensed model to the SaaS model. That will cost us millions of dollars and, if we commit to it, would be our #1 strategic priority for next year, to the exclusion of all others. Prior to committing to
doing that, we’d like to have external confirmation that this isn’t insane.”)</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Quotes</h1>

<p>Steve Jobs: Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it&rsquo;s really how it works.</p>

<p>Paul Rand: Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that&rsquo;s why it is so
complicated.</p>

<p>Stefan Sagmeister: You can have an art experience in front of a Rembrandt… or in front of a piece of graphic design.</p>

<p>Michael Bierut: If you do good work for good clients, it will lead to other good work for other good clients. If you do bad work for bad clients, it will lead to other bad work for other bad clients.</p>

<p>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</p>

<p>Chip Kidd: Never fall in love with an idea. They’re whores. If the one you’re with isn’t doing the job, there’s always, always, always another.</p>

<p><small>Jeffrey Zeldman: Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.</small></p>
