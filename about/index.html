              <p><span>I&rsquo;m an independent designer, entrepeneur and tech enthusiest usually in Ottawa, Ontario, but often in Toronto, too.</span></p>

<p><span>I&rsquo;m also Director of Marketing at <a href="http://athletebuilder.com/">Athlete Builder</a> , a complete sports e-learning platform.</span></p>

<p></br></p>

<h4>STARTUPS</h4>

<p>I love the culture of startups: the optimism, the naiveté, the confusion, the chaos, the compression.</p>

<p>I regularly mentor and consult with &ldquo;sports education&rdquo; startups and try to nurture connections where connections should be.</p>

<p>For a little over a year, I was privileged to work at Athlete Builder as a marketing director. My main focus has been prepairing Athlete Builder for launch.<!-- I am indebted to the great opportunity Rob, Evan, Marcos and the rest of the company extended to me. So much so, I made them a love letter(book?).--></p>

<p><small>Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that&rsquo;s why it is so complicated. -Paul Rand</small></p>

<h3>PERSPECTIVE</h3>

<p>Travel is my drug. Usually prescription based, although, at times, it can
feel illicit.</p>

<p>I bounce between San Francisco, New York and Tokyo. Sometimes, people have a
hard time understanding why. They tilt their heads. To me, it&rsquo;s simple: stay
sharp. Each time the plane lands I can hear the crisp scrape of my senses pushed across a whetstone.</p>

<p><small>Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration. -Jeffrey Zeldman</small></p>

<h3>OPTIMISM</h3>

<p>I strive to be a technology optimist. Optimism is a meditation requiring
constant application. I believe technological change is like a freight train of
a certain unstoppablemomentum, and we have two broad choices:</p>

<p>• Stubbornly stand in front of the train and try to push it back</p>

<p>• Accept the train and be a force laying railroad ties which place it on a
nourishing course</p>

<p>I choose the second option, and that choice informs the way I look at how
digital infrastructure is affecting books, publishing and education. I like that
we're irrationallyemotional about the loss of physicality in books. We&rsquo;re
explorers, and the first rule of the Explorer&rsquo;s Club is: always choose a
disrupted space filled with intense emotion.</p>

<p><small>Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it&rsquo;s really how it works. -Steve Jobs</small></p>

<h3>SEE CHANGE</h3>

<p>I believe there is an emerging confluence of simple technologies around books, publishing, networks and education that can be leveraged to change the way we
think about learning and information accessibility. If you&rsquo;re working in this space, I&rsquo;d love to chat.</p>

<p>I think of the liminal space publishing now occupies as the pre/post era of publishing. We&rsquo;re post- the formality, complexity and physicality that so defined publishing following Gutenberg (and Aldus Manutius and Walter Benjamin
and …). But yet we&rsquo;re still pre- substantive alternatives.</p>

<p>The old guard is crumbling. A new guard is awkwardly emerging. Together, we can affect the shape of the new guard. Isn&rsquo;t that exciting?</p>
